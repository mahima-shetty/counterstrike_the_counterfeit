### Organizations suffer a lot of man power loss. The reasons may be plenty if we brainstorm on this. But in terms of data, we have handsome number of characteristics which can determine whether the employee will stay or leave the organization

These are the top reasons employees decide to quit their jobs:
- Needing more of a challenge.
- Looking for a higher salary.
- Feeling uninspired.
- Wanting to feel valued.
- Seeking a better management relationship.
- Searching for job growth and career advancement.
- Needing more feedback or structure.

This can be used to determine whether the employee will stay or not.
